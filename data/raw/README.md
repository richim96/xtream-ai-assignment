# Diamonds Dataset
This dataset provides detailed information on diamond prices and their attributes, some of which are known 
to affect their value. The prices are reported in 2008 US Dollars.

Key features include the 4 Cs: `carat`, `cut`, `color`, and `clarity`, along with physical measurements 
such as `depth`, `table`, `price`, `x`, `y`, and `z`.

The **Carat** is a unit of mass, equal to 200 mg, used for measuring gemstones and pearls.
The **Cut Grade** is an objective assessment of a diamond's light performance, often perceived as sparkle.
